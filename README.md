# Ad Optimization Project Summary

## Project Overview

This project dives deep into the performance of video ad campaigns, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) like Click-Through Rate (CTR), Activation Rate, and the relationship between ad spend and customer acquisition. After scrutinizing the data for inconsistencies and potential outliers, a comprehensive analysis unveiled both the campaigns' strengths and areas ripe for improvement.

## Performance Summary

The investigation began with skepticism towards the campaigns' unusually high CTR and Activation Rates, which initially seemed unrealistic compared to industry standards. However, deeper analysis, accounting for missing data and potential outliers, revealed a more nuanced understanding of the campaign's effectiveness.

### Key Insights

- **Ad Engagement:** Identified opportunities for improvement in ad engagement, particularly for Science and Computer Science, due to lower Impression/Click ratios.
- **Conversion and Activation Rates:** Highlighted an issue with Math ads, which showed high engagement but lower subscription rates, suggesting a disconnect in the customer journey.
- **Overall Campaign Success:** Despite initial doubts, the data suggested promising outcomes, especially when evaluating the efficiency of ad spend relative to customer acquisition.

## Dashboard

As a pivotal part of this project, I developed a comprehensive dashboard that visually summarizes the campaign's performance. This dashboard is designed to be intuitive and informative, making it accessible to team members across different functions, regardless of their background in advertising.

### Dashboard Features:

- **Performance Over Time:** Tracks key metrics over the campaign period to identify trends and anomalies.
- **KPI Comparisons:** Offers side-by-side comparisons of crucial KPIs to assess the campaign's relative success.
- **Insightful Visualizations:** Utilizes charts and graphs to provide a clear view of data distributions, highlighting areas of success and opportunities for improvement.

## Next Steps and Recommendations

### Focus Areas for Improvement

1. **Enhancing Ad Engagement:** Specifically for Science and Computer Science ads, where creative and targeting adjustments could significantly boost performance.
2. **Boosting Conversions:** Aiming to improve conversion rates by refining the onboarding process and ensuring a seamless transition from ad to landing page.
3. **Addressing Subscription Leakage:** Investigating the drop-off in Math ad conversions to identify and rectify barriers to subscription.

### Implementation Strategy

Adopting a systematic approach, the actions are to analyze, prioritize, and test various strategies to enhance the campaign's effectiveness, leveraging the dashboard to monitor progress and inform decisions.
